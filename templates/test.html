First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can initialize a new Node.js project and install Express by running:

npm init -y
npm install express
Now, you can create a file named app.js and add the following code:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a GET route
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  const responseData = {
    message: "Hello, world!",
    status: "success",
    data: {
      id: 1,
      name: "Sample Item"
    }
  };

  // Send the JSON response
  res.json(responseData);
});

// Start the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT});
});
To run the app, execute the following command in your terminal:

node app.js
Once the server is running, you can visit http://localhost:3000/data in your web browser or use a tool like curl or Postman to make a GET request to that route. You should see a JSON response like this:

{
  "message": "Hello, world!",
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sample Item"
  }
}
